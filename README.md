# Code Is Law

# Assignment:
Write a short paper that addresses either (or both) of the following ideas, in any manner you choose:
1. Reflect on what's been easy and what's been hard about learning how to code this semester.  What particular traits or skills are important for software development?  How are these skills similar to, or different from, what's required in your law studies?
2. Has this course affected your understanding of the intersections of law and technology?  What do you think will be the important questions or areas of law that you think will be most affected in the near future (say, within the next 10 years)?
Or, make up your own questions! That would be even better :-)
I'm not looking for any particular length.  I will award up to 10 points at my sole discretion, based on how well your writing demonstrates your growth in understanding this semester.

# Introduction

In many ways, coding is a similar way of thinking as that taught in law school, albeit with drastically different subject matter. In law school, we read a bunch of old cases and then try to formulate a generalized rule using deductive reasoning. Then, we apply this rule to the case at hand, attempting to persuade a judge why s/he should decide a case in our favor.

Broadly, I think I’ve learned coding the best by applying a similar technique: reading the code of others or perusing StackOverflow for code, and then figuring out how that code works so that it can be applied to my project. Now, what makes coding infinitely more difficult is that it’s black and white: either your code works or it does not – either you figure out the way the code works, or you don’t. In legal arguments, the judge decides if you’re right. Lawyers live in the grey area, massaging facts or laws to try to direct the judge towards an outcome favorable to their client. For coders though, there is no grey space. Sure, it seems that there are many best practices, but that arguing tabs and spaces is different than arguing the definition of “cruel and unusual punishment” under the Eighth Amendment.

## Four Forces
One of the more interesting ideas I’ve come across is the notion that compute code regulates conduct much the same way legal conduct does (first argued by Lawrence Lessing in the late 90s). He went so far as to say that humans are “regulated” or impacted by four things: law, technological architecture, markets, and norms. It’s interesting to compare the first two in terms of what we’ve learned in this class as compared to our other law school classes. Laws and regulations simply create a system of incentives designed to influence how people act and interact with each other. Likewise, technology comes with its own set of incentives. On the minds of technologists and regulators recently is the incentives underlying not only our interaction with others on social media, but the very business models and structures underlying these systems. Advertising, data collection and surveillance, etc. They’ve all come to a head recently and are making people reevaluate the free-wheeling nature of these systems, bringing technology and the law into conflict once again.

Interestingly, another of Lessig’s four pillars of regulation was markets, broadly thought of as the buying, selling and trading of goods and services. I recently read a book review for a forthcoming [book](https://www.amazon.com/Efficiency-Paradox-What-Data-Cant/dp/1400041392/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1523197585&sr=8-1&keywords=edward+tenner&dpID=410-sIaaQaL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch/marginalrevol-20) that compares the rise of “Big Tech” to the rise of finance in the last century. At their core, both are aimed at achieving efficiency. In fact, many tech innovations are actually transactional innovations, easing the ability for consumers to transact with businesses or each other. The book also points out how modern finance is now defined by portfolio theory, and social network (and other) tech has promulgated the idea of “life as a portfolio”: more, shorter interactions with more people.
